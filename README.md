It seems that the only data we will get when ranking is "Operating Reserve". Therefore, TML and DL methods based on full version data will not be adopted in Ranking Algorithm.


## More experiments results:
- Some **data analysis** and **preprocessing** were adoped in folder `\1_traditinal_ML`
- Traditional Machine Learning including **K-Neighbor**, **SupportVevtor**, **NuSVR**, **DecisionTree**, **RandomForest**, **Adaboost**, **GradientBoosting**, and **ARIMA** approaches were structured in folder `\1_Traditional_ML`.
- Deep Learning approaches including **CNN**, **DNN**, **RNN**, **LSTM**, **BLSTM**, **CRNN**, **FCN** (Fully Convolutional Network), **Transformer** were structured in folder `\2_DL`.
